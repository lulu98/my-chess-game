# My Chess Game
Demonstration video: http://www.lukas-graber.tk/projects/chess_game.html
## Introduction
This application is a simple chess game built with Python. The graphics engine is also built with Python. By now there are timers available for both players and an option to turn back time as far as you want. The timers won't be updated, because if you want to go back to think about a move, you at least need some disadvantage.
